# From-Shelter-to-Home-Predicting-Pet-Adoption-with-Machine-Learning
Some shelter pets find homes quickly; others wait weeks or months. Those delays increase costs, crowd space, and harm animal welfare. We predict adoption speed (an ordinal outcome with five classes: 0–4) using a multimodal approach that fuses tabular features (age, breed, health), text embeddings from descriptions, and image features. We compare three pipelines-tabular‑only, tabular+text, and full multimodal-then optimize a late‑fusion ensemble for Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). Our best ensemble reaches QWK = 0.461, ~14% higher than the best single model. The practical takeaway: write warmer, specific descriptions, retake blurry photos, and triage likely slow adopters at intake.
